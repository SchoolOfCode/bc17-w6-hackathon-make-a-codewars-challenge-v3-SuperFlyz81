# Two Sum Problem JavaScript Code Kata Challenge

## Installation

1. Create a local folder on your PC to host the node project.
2. "cd" into your newly created local folder.
3. Clone down the Git repo from GitHub to your local folder using the following terminal command:<br>
   `git clone https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/bc17-w6-hackathon-make-a-codewars-challenge-v3-SuperFlyz81.git .`
4. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies for the node project.

## Usage

- Run the code kata test runner by issuing the following command in the terminal:<br>
  `npm run test`

## Kata Instructions

- You can now type your code kata solution in the `main.js` file.
- The code kata uses `vitest` (similar to Jest) to provide an interactive testing experience.
- So your code will be tested in a "live reloading" fashion, every time you save the `main.js` file.
