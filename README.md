# üî• Kata: You Shall Not Pass! A Two Sum Problem-Solving Quest üî•

### Help Gandalf defeat the Balrog by solving the <ins>Two Sum Problem</ins>.

![You Shall Not Pass!](./assets/images/lotr-you-shall-not-pass.gif)

The two sum software engineering problem is commonly found in junior developer interviews and tech tests. It falls under the category of algorithmic problems related to array processing. This code kata will teach you how to solve the two-sum problem, just in time for your next developer interview, and to save the "fellowship" from a scorching "Balrog barbecue"!

## üìú Lore

Gandalf the Grey is engaged in a battle of epic proportions on the Bridge of Khazad-d√ªm, deep in the Mines of Moria. His arch-nemesis, the Balrog, is roaring, fire is blazing, and Gandalf is running out of clever one-liners. "You shall not pass!" is not cutting it anymore.

To save the day, he needs to combine exactly two of his magical spells to match the precise power needed to vanquish the Balrog. The spells are a bit quirky and have power levels represented by integers. Gandalf, being a wizard but not exactly a JavaScript developer, needs your help to figure out which two spells to use.

## üìã Task

Given an array of integers representing the power levels of Gandalf's spells and an integer target representing the exact power needed to defeat the Balrog, you must find <ins>the indices</ins> of the two spells whose combined power matches the target. Remember, Gandalf can‚Äôt just wave his staff and magically know the answer‚Äîhe‚Äôs counting on you!

## ‚úÖ Requirements

#### 1. Function Signature

```
function findTwoSumIndices(numbers, target) {
  // Your code goes here
}
```

#### 2. Input

- An array `numbers` where each element is an integer, representing the magical power of each spell.
- An integer `target` which is the total power Gandalf needs.

#### 3. Output

- An array containing two integers.
- These integers are the indices of the numbers (a.k.a. the magical spell powers) that sum up to the target.
- **Return these two indices in an array to pass the test.**
- If the target cannot be satisfied by summing two numbers from the numbers array, then just return an empty array.

#### 4. Constraints

- If there are multiple pairs of numbers whose sum meets the target, return the first pair found (hint: your code will probably do this for you automatically üòâ).

## ‚úèÔ∏è Examples

```
findTwoSumIndices([2, 4, 6, 8], 10); // returns [0, 3] since 2 + 8 = 10
findTwoSumIndices([1, 3, 5, 7], 8);  // returns [0, 3] since 1 + 7 = 8
findTwoSumIndices([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 9); // returns [3, 4] since 4 + 5 = 9
findTwoSumIndices([7, 5, 3, 1], 8); returns [0, 3] since 7 + 1 = 8
findTwoSumIndices([1, 2, 3, 4], 8); returns [] since we cannot satisfy the target
findTwoSumIndices([8, 4, 2, 6], 10); returns [0, 2] since 8 + 2 = 10
```

#### Explanations

##### In the first example

- Gandalf‚Äôs spell list is [2, 4, 6, 8].
- The target power is 10.
- The spell at index 0 has a power level of 2, and the spell at index 3 has a power level of 8.
- When these two spells combine their powers, they total 10, saving the day and proving Gandalf's wizardry isn‚Äôt just for show. The function returns [0, 3].

##### In the second example

- Gandalf‚Äôs spell list is [1, 3, 5, 7].
- The target is 8.
- The spell at index 0 has a power level of 1, and the spell at index 3 has a power level of 7.
- Combining these spells gives a total of 8, so the function returns [0, 3].

##### Further examples

- Additional examples (examples three to six) have been included for reference purposes.

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hints

### ü™Ñ Hint 1: Help! I don't even know where to start

<details>
  <summary>Click here to see the hint</summary>
As mentioned at the beginning of this document, the two sum problem is an array processing problem. So begin by writing a nested `for` loop (a for loop within another for loop) to iterate through all possible numbers in the `numbers` array.
</details>

### ü™Ñ Hint 2: I'm still stuck, how about some pseudo code to help me out?

<details>
  <summary>Click here to see the hint</summary>
Sure thing, here you go...

```
export function findTwoSumIndices(numbers, target) {
  // Loop through the numbers

    // Compare every other number that comes after the current number

      // If the sum of the current number and the next number equals the target, return their

// If no such pair is found, return an empty array
}
```

</details>

### ü™Ñ Hint 3: By Durin's Beard, I'm still at a loss! Please provide me with a redacted code example and I'll fill in the blanks

<details>
  <summary>Click here to see the hint</summary>
Your wish is my command... Just fill in the #'s bellow with variable names, letters, or numbers to complete the findTwoSumIndices() function.

```
export function findTwoSumIndices(numbers, target) {
  // Loop through the numbers
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    // Compare every other number that comes after the current number
    for (let j = i + #; j < numbers.length; j++) {
      // If the sum of the current number and the next number equals the target, return their indices
      if (numbers[#] + numbers[#] === target) {
        return [#, #];
      }
    }
  }

  return []; // If no such pair is found, return an empty array
}
```

### üí° Other Possible Solutions

There may be more advanced solutions to the two sum problem. For example, the for loops above could be replaced by JavaScript array methods like `forEach` or `map`. Try to copy and paste the code above into your favourite AI companion ü§ñ. Then ask it for more advanced or concise JavaScript code examples to solve the two sum problem.

## TODOs

- Rename README.md to something else and then move the content of PROJECT_PRESENTATION TO README.md to make this file the main readme for your project. ‚úÖ
- There is a code commenting TODO left to complete at the top of main.js. ‚úÖ
- Add a collapsible (hidden by default) "hints" section with multiple layers of hints. ‚úÖ
- Add a collapsible (hidden by default) "solution" section showcasing the final solution (as currently detailed in main.js). ‚úÖ
- Create a PLANNING.MD document if there is time left. This should contain details above your ideation process, planning process, etc. ALSO LINK to this new PLANNING.md file in your new README.md file. ‚úÖ
- Add an "installation" section to show how to get the project up and running.
- IMPORTANT: Remember to delete your "solution" code from main.js and push everything (including this empty function) back up to GitHub.
- Run a manual end-to-end test of your entire project.
- Finally, reread the original requirements/objective in the original README.md file to make sure you've hit the brief.
